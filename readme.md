# Learning Linked Lists

For AcademyPGH Bookclub, I wanted to learn more about linked lists - exploring how they work and different implementation examples.

* `linked_list.rb` is an implementation of a singly linked list with two classes-node and linked list.
* `linked_list_spec.rb` contains unit tests

### Resources
I used the following resources to help me understand Linked Lists. In particular, I found it helpful to use the different code examples as a daily warmup kata before attempting to work on my own.

* [AcademyPGH Linked List Stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/899743456?filter=all&sort=time)
    * The code from the talk is [available here](https://github.com/jeanlange/linked-list-demo)
* [Ruby Guides Linked List](https://www.rubyguides.com/2017/08/ruby-linked-list/)
